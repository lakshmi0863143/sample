    text: 'State Bank of India (SBI) is an Indian multinational public sector bank
      and financial services statutory body headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
      SBI is the 48th largest bank in the world by total assets and ranked 221st in
      the Fortune Global 500 list of the world''s biggest corporations of 2020, being
      the only Indian bank on the list.[11] It is a public sector bank and the largest
      bank in India[12] with a 23% market share by assets and a 25% share of the total
      loan and deposits market.[13] It is also the tenth largest employer in India
      with nearly 250,000 employees.[14][15][16] On 14 September 2022, State Bank
      of India became the third lender (after HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank) and seventh
      Indian company to cross the â‚¹ 5-trillion market capitalisation on the Indian
      stock exchanges for the first time.[17]


      The bank descends from the Bank of Calcutta, founded in 1806 via the Imperial
      Bank of India, making it the oldest commercial bank in the Indian subcontinent.
      The Bank of Calcutta merged with the other two presidency banks in British India,
      the Bank of Bombay and the Bank of Madras, to form the Imperial Bank of India,
      which in turn became the State Bank of India in 1955.[18] Overall the bank has
      been formed from the merger and acquisition of more than twenty banks over the
      course of its 200 year history.[19][20] The Government of India took control
      of the Imperial Bank of India in 1955, with Reserve Bank of India (India''s
      central bank) taking a 60% stake, renaming it State Bank of India.


      On 16th Aug 2022 an attempt to facilitate and support start-ups in the country,
      the State Bank of India (SBI) announced the launch of its first "state-of-the-art"
      dedicated branch for start-ups in the country in Bengaluru.[21]', font_size: 13,
